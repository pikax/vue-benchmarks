## Results

Ranked on the **median of measured runs**. Warm series follow ≥1 discarded warmup and are the primary ordering and ranking metric wherever both series exist. Compiler and Component-meta additionally publish a separately sampled **Fresh child** column: the first timed row workload in a new child process, after excluded process startup and package imports. It is not called Cold and its ratio/noise gate never substitutes for Warm. What else the child excludes differs by surface and each surface states it in its own methodology — Compiler builds its compiler host outside the timer, Component-meta builds its checker/session inside it, because its warm timer does too. Every table sorts fastest-first and every ratio column is **vs fastest** — the fastest ranked row is the 1.00x denominator; no tool is pinned as a reference. One table per surface unless that surface declares explicit work-equivalence classes; engine, invocation and threading are row properties, not implicit table splits — rows tagged **(JS)** run the JavaScript TypeScript compiler (a cross-engine ratio measures TypeScript's rewrite as much as the tool), and a row's label/notes say whether it is a CLI (pays process startup every run), an in-process API, single-threaded or a thread pool. Name markers: ⚠ failed validation (time bracketed, unranked) · ❌ error · ⏭ skipped. A row above CV 50% with at least three warm samples is bracketed as TOO NOISY TO RANK, no tool exempted (a two-run spread has no third sample to adjudicate, so it is flagged, not bracketed). Per-row detail is under **Notes** below each table.

> **Peak RSS** on a timing row is the tool's peak resident set: measured in the timed session where the runner samples it (LSP servers, real-world CLIs), otherwise injected from the isolated memory probe below — the probe runs each tool in its own process, separate from timing.

- **Biome format** — biome format --write — multi-threaded; the exact pinned row rewrites none of the planted .vue corpus and is unranked on the full-SFC format surface.

<details><summary>Methodology</summary>

- Each invocation receives a fresh copy of the same Vue SFC corpus (formatters rewrite files).
- Prettier is the explicit established-reference denominator for the full-Vue-SFC CLI comparison class. A faster candidate never silently becomes the baseline.
- .prettierrc.json and biome.json are written only into disposable work copies; the input fixture or checked-out real-world project is never overwritten. Both configs set the same indent, width, quote, semicolon and trailing-comma choices.
- All four formatters are CLI invocations and share the same non-zero-exit policy — no tool is failed for a diagnostic another tool is forgiven for.
- Output style is NOT normalized across tools — this measures format throughput, not style identity. Spot-checked: on a messy SFC, oxfmt and Prettier produce byte-identical output and Vize reformats template + script + style, so no tool is winning by no-op.
- Oxfmt 0.64.0 is a hybrid native/JS package. Its shipped native binding delegates a full .vue file to the bundled JS formatFile callback, whose implementation calls bundled Prettier with parser=vue; worker orchestration remains oxfmt's. Its output is byte-identical to Prettier on the work-gate probe. This is pinned-version evidence and must be re-audited after an oxfmt upgrade rather than assumed forever.
- Every work copy and gate plant carries an empty .git dir as a repo-boundary marker: walk tools that honour ancestor .gitignore rules (oxfmt 0.63+) otherwise inherit THIS repo's exclusion of the work/ dir the copies live in, see zero files, and get unranked for walking reasons rather than formatting ones. A real project root has the boundary; the marker changes no tool's invocation.
- FORMAT SEMANTIC GATE (untimed, post-timing): suite 2026-08-20.1 runs 3 nested plants twice through each row's exact directory/glob command and shared configs. Every plant must remain parseable and idempotent; preserve SFC block attrs/custom blocks and template/script AST meaning; preserve scoped/module/v-bind/deep/slotted/global CSS constructs; and actually rewrite the messy template. Generated output is never compared between tools. Every outcome and the suite hash are retained in validation.formatSemantics.
- FILE-COVERAGE GATE, untimed, per tool with its exact timed invocation: every corpus file is planted with a mess (trailing spaces, stacked blank lines) that any formatter under the shared configs must undo, and files rewritten are counted by byte comparison — the same method for every tool. A ranked tool that rewrites fewer than every corpus file is measured but UNRANKED: tools walking different file sets are not doing the same job, however similar the clock looks. A walk-invoked tool that also rewrites a config file is disclosed, not gated (one extra tiny file is noise; skipping corpus files is not).
- Prettier, Oxfmt, and Vize format the whole SFC. On the pinned Biome, `biome format --write .` reports .vue files as formatted but applies NO fixes to any block of them (probed: 0 of 50 planted files rewritten, 'No fixes applied') — its bracketed time is a walk-and-parse, which both gates say on the row. Rule/option parity is not guaranteed for any tool.
- Tool order is rotated on every warmup and measured run; ranking metric is the median of warmed runs.

## Validation (plants)

Executable correctness checks — planted errors that must be reported, clean fixtures that must stay clean. A fast tool that misses plants cannot rank as a correct one; gate failures surface as ⚠ in the timing tables.
