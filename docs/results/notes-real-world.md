# Real-world project results — how to read

> How to read every table in this README section — the ranking rules, the standing notes and

Ranked on the **median of measured runs** (each after ≥1 discarded warmup; no cold column — it would measure JIT warmup). One table per surface: engine, invocation and threading are row properties, not table splits — rows tagged **(JS)** run the JavaScript TypeScript compiler (a cross-engine ratio measures TypeScript's rewrite as much as the tool), and a row's label/notes say whether it is a CLI (pays process startup every run), an in-process API, single-threaded or a thread pool. Name markers: ⚠ failed validation (time bracketed, unranked) · ❌ error · ⏭ skipped. Per-row detail is under **Notes** below each table.

**Standing notes** — these apply to every block in the section (each full report carries its own copy):

- Corpora are pinned checkouts of third-party open-source Vue projects; sources are unmodified and every row names its project, ref and resolved commit SHA.
- Rank WITHIN a corpus, never across. The corpora differ in size and in kind — library source, application source, and documentation demos are not the same code, and a docs-demo SFC is a fraction of the size of a library component.
- The generated fixtures/N corpus remains the primary ranking corpus. It is content-unique by construction and carries planted bugs, which is what makes the work gates possible; real-world code cannot be gated that way because nobody knows where its bugs are.
- Real-world corpora exist to catch what a generated corpus cannot: constructs nobody thought to generate. Treat a failure here as a finding about the tool, and a speed number here as secondary to fixtures/N.
- Corpora are COMPLETE: no --file-limit was applied, so every SFC under each corpus root was measured. This is the default, because a limit takes an alphabetical prefix by path — a systematically narrower corpus rather than a sample of one.
- A project shipping no lockfile cannot be installed frozen, so its dependency set is whatever resolved on the day. Rows on the surfaces that execute those dependencies (project-test, project-build, project-typecheck, project-component-meta, project-lsp) are UNRANKED for such a corpus — equally for every tool, baseline included, because it is a property of the corpus and not of any tool.
- Surface "component-meta" is not run on a LIFTED real-world corpus: not offered on a LIFTED corpus — a corpus pulled out of a monorepo resolves none of its imports, and a metadata extractor whose imports do not resolve returns components with no props very quickly. Ask for project-component-meta, which runs in the checkout against the project's own tsconfig.
- Surface "lsp" is not run on a LIFTED real-world corpus: not offered on a LIFTED corpus — same resolution requirement, plus the workspace has to be the project itself for a language server's project load to mean anything. Ask for project-lsp.
- Surface "typecheck" is not run on a LIFTED real-world corpus: not offered on a LIFTED corpus — see project-typecheck, which runs in the checkout against the project's own tsconfig.
- Compile results are **grouped by target × environment × source map**, then by comparison class.
- Target: `vdom` · Environment: `production` · Source map: `off`
- Grouped by **bundler**, ranked within each group by Vue integration. Rows from different bundlers are never ranked against each other: read **across a row** (same bundler, different integration) for the Vue layer, and **down a column** (same integration, different bundler) for bundler architecture — the second is context, not a verdict.
- Two independent measurements. Cold start is paid once per session; HMR turnaround is paid on every save. Do not compare a row across the two tables.
- Ranked **per operation** — never pooled. The two operations differ by orders of magnitude and answer unrelated questions (cold project load vs a warm request), and a ratio across engines measures TypeScript's own Go rewrite at least as much as the Vue layer on top of it. A row that failed its content gate is shown in brackets and excluded from ranking: latency without an answer is not a comparable measurement.
- ⓘ One table for both TypeScript engines — rows tagged **(JS)** run the JavaScript compiler, the rest native tsgo; a cross-engine ratio measures TypeScript's Go rewrite as much as the Vue layer on top of it.

## Tools

What actually ran, by the name the tables use. Bullets are kept verbatim from the surface legends, so a name can appear once per distinct description (e.g. a CLI and an in-process variant).

- **Prettier** — prettier --write over a fresh corpus copy; built-in Vue SFC support, single-threaded by design.
- **Oxfmt** — oxfmt --write — Oxc's Vue-capable formatter, multi-threaded.
- **Vize** — vize fmt --write.
- **Biome format** — biome format --write — multi-threaded, but formats the &lt;script> block only; template and style come back byte-identical, so it is unranked on the format surface.
- **Biome lint (1T)** — biome lint with RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1 — script block only. No template rules, so it misses the planted vue/no-v-html and reports template-only variable uses as unused; unranked.
- **Biome lint (max threads)** — biome lint on all cores — script block only. No template rules, so it misses the planted vue/no-v-html and reports template-only variable uses as unused; unranked.
- **Oxlint (1T)** — oxlint --threads=1 with its vue plugin enabled — script block only. The plugin's 31 Vue rules all read &lt;script>; &lt;template> is never parsed, so the planted vue/no-v-html is missed; unranked.
- **Oxlint (max threads)** — oxlint on all cores with its vue plugin enabled — script block only, misses the planted vue/no-v-html; unranked.
- **Volar (JS)** — @vue/language-server v3 hybrid pair — the Vue server plus typescript-language-server with @vue/typescript-plugin; both processes are measured and the slower half is charged.
- **Volar (N)** — the same Volar pair with its TypeScript half on typescript-native-bridge (tsgo) — same Vue layer, native engine.
- **Verter** — verter-lsp — the native server from the published npm package (version in the notes). Runs stable tsgo.
- **Vize** — vize lsp --stdio from the npm package (native standalone server when found, Node entry otherwise — the row's notes say which). Runs its own bundled tsgo (Corsa).
- **vue-tsc (JS)** — the official Vue Language Tools CLI — vue-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json, stock JavaScript TypeScript engine.
- **vue-tsc (N)** — the same vue-tsc with typescript aliased to typescript-native-bridge (tsgo) — same Vue layer, native engine.
- **verter-tsc** — verter-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json from the published npm package; runs stable tsgo.
- **Vize** — vize check --tsconfig tsconfig.json (native, Corsa when available).
