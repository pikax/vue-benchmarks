### Methodology notes

- Primary ranking metric is the **median of measured runs**. Every measured run is preceded by at least one discarded warmup pass (enforced — `--warmups 0` is clamped to 1).
- There is **no cold column**. An unwarmed first run costs a JS compiler ~3.2x its steady state and a native compiler nothing, so ranking on it measures V8 warmup rather than the tool.
- Min / stddev / CV% are reported per row. CV% > 10 is flagged ⚠ — treat that row as noisy (thermal drift or a contended runner), not as a result.
- Status is a marker on the tool NAME, not a column: ⚠ failed a validation gate (time in brackets, unranked) · ❌ error · ⏭ skipped. Per-row detail is in the collapsible **Notes** under each table, and each surface carries a **Tools** legend naming what actually ran.
- Each surface is ONE table. Engine, invocation and threading are row properties, not table splits: a CLI pays process startup on every run (~85ms measured for one native CLI) while an in-process API amortises it, and a thread pool is not a single thread — the row's label and notes say which mode it ran, so compare like with like.
- Rows tagged **(JS)** run the JavaScript TypeScript compiler, untagged typecheck/LSP rows run native tsgo. A cross-engine ratio measures TypeScript's Go rewrite as much as the Vue layer on top of it.
- Surfaces are independent: compile ms is not comparable to jsx-compile/typecheck/lint/format ms.
- jsx-compile uses fixtures/jsx-N (.jsx); SFC compile uses fixtures/N (.vue).
- Compile matrix cells (VDOM/Vapor × production/development × sourcemap on/off) are independent.
- Source map is an explicit, independent dimension applied identically to every compiler — it is never folded into the production/development flag for some tools and not others.
- Primary compile corpus is unique file contents (fixtures/N).
- Content-hash caches skip work on duplicate bodies — unique fixtures required for ranking.
- Tool order is **rotated** on every warmup and measured run, so no tool is pinned to the expensive first slot.
- CI does not drop OS page cache; later tools in a job may share a warmer file cache.
- Typecheck/lint/format tools that fail a work gate are unranked (skipped). Typecheck gates require both a script-level and a template-level diagnostic, and are re-verified against the full timed corpus. Lint gates require the planted vue/no-v-html. The format gate requires the tool to actually rewrite the &lt;template> block, so a script-only formatter is not ranked against whole-SFC formatters.
- Compile measures assert non-empty codegen where applicable.
- Vue official compiler is 1T only (worker_threads variants removed).
- LSP: every server resolves from its installed npm package and is skipped when absent — no local-build or working-copy discovery, so each row names a version.
- verter-tsc needs stable tsgo (typescript@7.0.x via typescript-go); harness sets VERTER_TSGO_BIN.
- Diagnostic/format identity across tools is not required for throughput rows.

### SFC compile (⚠ 199 duplicate bodies — content-hash caches may inflate throughput)

Files: **200** · Bytes: **46,600**

Compile results are **grouped by target × environment × source map**, then by comparison class.

#### VDOM · production · sourcemap off

Target: `vdom` · Environment: `production` · Source map: `off`

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

- **Vize native batch (max threads)**: compileSfcBatchWithResults vapor=false, sourceMap=false. multi-thread Rayon batch. ⚠ No isProduction flag — identical work in production and development cells. Content-hash caches can skip work on repeated bodies — unique corpus required for ranking.
- **fervid compileSync (1T)**: compileSync isProduction=true, sourceMap=false, single-threaded. ⚠ also compiles &lt;style> blocks (scoped styles returned isCompiled=true) — strictly more work per file than the parse+script+template rows it is ranked against. ⚠ emits non-fatal NonVoidHtmlElementStartTagWithTrailingSolidus diagnostics for self-closing non-void tags (&lt;div />, &lt;MyComp />) that Vue's SFC parser accepts; codegen is complete regardless, so the row is gated on codegen produced for every file, not on diagnostic silence.
- **Verter compileMany (session cache)**: runtime-render forceVapor=false, isProduction=true, sourceMap=false, mode=session, analysis=full — persistent host, cacheHits reported; not comparable to the cache-free batch rows cacheHits≈0
- **fervid compileAsync (4-thread libuv pool)**: compileAsync isProduction=true, sourceMap=false, fanned out with Promise.all over libuv's threadpool (UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=4, default 4 — NOT sized to core count like a Rayon pool, so on a runner with more than 4 cores this row is thread-capped below the batch rows beside it). ⚠ also compiles &lt;style> blocks (scoped styles returned isCompiled=true) — strictly more work per file than the parse+script+template rows it is ranked against. ⚠ emits non-fatal NonVoidHtmlElementStartTagWithTrailingSolidus diagnostics for self-closing non-void tags (&lt;div />, &lt;MyComp />) that Vue's SFC parser accepts; codegen is complete regardless, so the row is gated on codegen produced for every file, not on diagnostic silence.
- **Vize native loop (1T)**: compileSfc vapor=false, sourceMap=false. ⚠ Vize has no isProduction flag on compileSfc — this row does identical work in the production and development cells. Content-hash caches reward duplicate bodies — use unique fixtures for ranking.
- **@vue/compiler-sfc 3.6 (1T)**: Official 3.6 VDOM, isProd=true, sourceMap=false
- **@vue/compiler-sfc 3.5 (1T)**: Official 3.5 VDOM, isProd=true, sourceMap=false, single-threaded
- **Verter compileMany (stateless)**: runtime-render forceVapor=false, isProduction=true, sourceMap=false, hmr=none, mode=stateless, analysis=full, multi-thread host pool cacheHits≈0

<details><summary>Methodology</summary>

- Matrix: target ∈ {vdom, vapor} × env ∈ {production, development} × sourceMap ∈ {off, on}. Cells are independent — do not cross-compare cells.
- Corpus mode=repeated: 1/200 unique content SHAs. Vize content-hash caches treat identical bodies as free — primary rankings must use unique fixtures (fixtures/N), not fixtures/N-repeated.
- Same in-memory Vue SFC corpus for every variant (compiler flags differ; sources do not).
- Work measured: parse SFC + compile script (if any) + compile template (if any).
- VDOM = classic Virtual DOM render functions. Vapor = direct DOM codegen (Vue 3.6+ / native tool vapor flags).
- Source map is an INDEPENDENT dimension, requested identically from every compiler in a cell (Vue: parse+compileScript+codegen sourceMap; Vize: compileSfc sourceMap; Verter: compileProfile sourceMap; fervid: FervidJsCompilerOptions sourceMap). It is not folded into the prod/dev flag for some tools and not others.
- Production vs development uses each tool's real semantic knobs only: Vue isProd (hoistStatic + cacheHandlers); Verter isProduction + hmrStrategy; fervid isProduction.
- ⚠ Vize exposes no isProduction on compileSfc, so its production and development rows perform identical work. Stated rather than substituted with a different knob.
- ⚠ fervid compiles &lt;style> blocks inside compileSync — every other row measures parse + script + template only. fervid's rows do strictly more work per file than the rows they are ranked against; there is no option to disable it.
- ⚠ fervid emits non-fatal HTML-strictness diagnostics (NonVoidHtmlElementStartTagWithTrailingSolidus) on self-closing non-void tags such as &lt;div /> and &lt;MyComp />, which Vue's SFC parser accepts — 44 of them on the 200-file corpus. Verified on this corpus: codegen is still complete and correct for those files, so fervid is gated on codegen actually being produced for every file — the same gate every other compiler here gets — rather than on diagnostic silence. Per-run diagnostic totals are captured in the JSON report's meta samples.
- fervid and Vue 3.5 have no Vapor path → skipped for vapor cells (not run as VDOM).
- fervid's compileAsync row fans out over libuv's threadpool (UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=4), which is a fixed default of 4 rather than core count. Where the Vize/Verter batch rows scale with cores, that row does not — it is reported, not tuned, because the pool width is fixed before the harness starts.
- 1T / batch / batch-cached rows share the table; the mode is in the row label. A batch pool amortises across a thread pool and a cached session reuses prior analysis, so read same-mode rows against each other.
- Verter session mode keeps a persistent host across warmups and runs, so it is ranked as `batch-cached`, apart from cache-free batch rows.
- Codegen validity gate: every compiler's output is parsed once (TypeScript plugin enabled, since several rows legitimately emit TS) before any timing. A tool that emits unparseable output for part of the corpus is measured but UNRANKED — bytes-per-millisecond is not a result if the bytes do not parse. Applied to every compiler in the table, re-run each benchmark, and self-clearing on a fixed release.
- Tool order is rotated on every warmup and measured run; no tool is pinned to first position.
- Ranking metric is the median of measured runs, all taken after >= 1 discarded warmup. No cold column.
